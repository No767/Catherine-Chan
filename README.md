The modern all-in-one toolkit for LGBTQ+ folks

<div align=left>

## Information

Catherine-Chan is the all in one toolkit for LGBTQ+ folks and allies. Catherine-Chan provides a wide variety of features, such as creating pride profiles, definitions for the LGBTQ+ community, and many others.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:
> I would prefer if you do not run instances of Catherine-Chan. Just use the `/invite` command or use the Top.gg invite to have the bot on your server instead.
> The code provided is for educational use, providing suggestions and feedback, and to catch issues only.

## Features

- [x] Pronouns Tester
- [x] Pride Profile creator (create profiles to let others know about your pronouns and more)
- [x] Informative pronouns and LGBTQ+ terms dictionary
- [x] Resources for support
- [x] HRT Measurement Conversion Calculator (consult your doctor first to ensure that it is accurate for you if you need to use this)

And so much more! If you want to suggest a feature, please open up a feature requests report on GitHub!

## Inviting the Bot

Catherine-Chan is live! You can invite her into your server with the following link: [Invite Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1142620675517984808&scope=bot+applications.commands)

## Support

If you would like to support me as a developer, please consider supporting me on [KoFi](https://ko-fi.com/no767). The money will go towards to hosting Catherine-Chan and all other server-related costs so you can expect the bot to be up 24/7! In addition, if you would like to support me with projects like these, please consider starring this project and other ones!
