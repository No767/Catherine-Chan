Motivation
==========

This page details the motivation on why I decided to build this bot. 

One of the reasons why I wanted to build this bot is seeing the lack of active LGBTQ+ focused bots. 
The biggest one I could find was Jade's `PrideBot <https://top.gg/bot/1066641327116255333>`_, which is currently down and has message contents issues. (gotta get that approved). 
And when looking up at pride bots, they all pretty much do exactly the same thing. I wanted a bot that would be useful 
just like Akari and Kumiko, and also be up with the latest Discord technologies and features (and general tech as well). Thus, Catherine-Chan was born. 

At the very end, the goal of Catherine-Chan is to completely replace Jade's PrideBot and to further expand it by merging features from other bots related to PrideBot.
