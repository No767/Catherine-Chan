Motivation
==========

This page details the motivation on why I decided to build this bot. 

One of the reasons why I wanted to build this bot is seeing the lack of active LGBTQ+ focused bots. 
The biggest one I could find was Jade's `PrideBot <https://top.gg/bot/1066641327116255333>`_, which is sadly not active.
And when looking up at pride bots, they all pretty much do exactly the same thing (which funnily enough is pride avatars). I wanted a bot that would be useful 
just like Akari and Kumiko, and also be up with the latest Discord technologies and features (and general tech as well). Thus, Catherine-Chan was born. 

Catherine-Chan is a cumulation of thousands of hours of Discord bot programming and mentorship, studying the codebase for `R. Danny <https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny>`_
(A multipurpose Discord bot used in over 9,000 servers created by Danny himself), design decisions from R. Danny, Kumiko, Xelt, Akari, recommendations by software engineers
working in industry, and many more. Ultimately Catherine-Chan is the cumulation of 2 years worth of 
continuous Discord bot programming, which has been my shining star and achievement. 

The codebase has been proudly open-sourced as an example of the dedication that I have
put into this bot. Feel free to study and to contribute from the codebase.
