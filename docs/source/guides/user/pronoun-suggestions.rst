Pronouns Suggestion
===================

These are all of the variables needed in order to properly sub in the correct values.


- Name: ``$name``
- Subjective Pronoun: ``$subjective_pronoun`` (Subjective / Nominative pronouns include ones like he, she, they, it, etc)
- Objective Pronoun: ``$objective_pronoun`` (Objective pronouns include them, him, her, etc)
- Possessive Pronoun: ``$possessive_pronoun`` (Possessive pronouns include his, hers, theirs, etc)
- Possessive Determiner: ``$possessive_determiner`` (Possessive determiners include his, her, their, etc)
- Reflective Pronoun: ``$reflective_pronoun`` (Reflective pronouns include himself, herself, themselves, etc)

Some examples can look like this (note that names are not fully capitalized correctly yet):

- ``$name is really cute! $subjective_pronoun looks really good in that outfit!``
- ``$name is a cutiepie uwu! $subjective_pronoun looks likes $subjective_pronoun is ready to go!``
- ``$name is a very lovely person!``
