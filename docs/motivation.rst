Motivation
==========

This page details the motivation on why I decided to build this bot. 

One of the reasons why I wanted to build this bot is seeing the lack of active LGBTQ+ focused bots. 
The biggest one I could find was Jade's `PrideBot <https://top.gg/bot/1066641327116255333>`_, which is sadly not active.
And when looking up at pride bots, they all pretty much do exactly the same thing (which funnily enough is pride avatars). I wanted a bot that would be useful 
just like Akari and Kumiko, and also be up with the latest Discord technologies and features (and general tech as well). Thus, Catherine-Chan was born. 

Catherine-Chan is a cumulation of thousands of hours of Discord bot programming and mentorship.
From the design decisions from `R. Danny <https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny>`_, Kumiko, Xelt, Akari, 
recommendations by software engineers working in industry,
and hours of studying the codebase for R. Danny, Catherine-Chan encompasses all of those.
Ultimately Catherine-Chan is the collection of 2 years worth of all of the efforts mentioned above.

The codebase has been proudly open-sourced as an example of the dedication that I have
put into this bot. Feel free to study and to contribute from the codebase.
